# Week 02 Homework - Demo Responsive Portfolio

## Summary

The goal of this project was to create a portfolio that is both accessible and 
responsive for desktop and mobile users utilising a mixture of bootstrap and custom css.
This needed to loosely follow a design specification.

## Main features

The portfolio features 3 main pages: Index (About Me), Portfolio, and Contact
Responsive Nav

### Index

The homepage of the webapp. It features a single main jumbotron to feature
personal info, I have filled in some placeholder data to showcase potential usage of the
space. The content will flow and rearrange itself based on screensize.

### Portfolio

Designed to showcase art/photography in a 2 column grid, single column on mobile. This page 
uses a snippet from bootstrapius.com to animate hover over image captions otherwise it is 
the simplest as it only contains user content, I may consider adding in links to sales pages 
etc. within the images further on down the line.

### Contact

A simple form used to send feedback or suggestions to an artist. Also utilises whitespace
to showcase a final feature portrait. 

### Nav

The nav was handwritten with aid from my tutor, I used a lot of the main ideas and techniques
shown but added my own flair with a highlighted button showing what page you are on and 
relative margins to make the buttons and header align with page content.
